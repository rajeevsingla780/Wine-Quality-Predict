# Wine-Quality-Predict
In this repository i've made a project on Wine quality prediction, With end to end deployment.

### Steps involved:
* Data Collection.
* Data Preprocessing.
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering.
* Feature Selection.
* Feature Transformation.
* Model Building.
* Model Evaluation.
* Model Selection.
* Predictions.
* Model Deployment.

In this project i've selected __RandomForestClassifier__ Algorithem which gives a better accuracy on the data rather than the other models.

 __A Machine learning web app, deployed in heroku__
